# Human-like Text Generation
As the rapid growth of generative AI, especially Large Language Model, recently many people use those models in various domains but in general they use it to generate some or more paragraphs that accelerate their works.
On the other hand, there are still a major number of people who are against using generative AI and they use tools to check if a work or essays for example contain AI contribution or not. Those tools can easily detect which is AI's text and which is non-AI text by checking AI fancy words which are unpopular in a human-made-content. In other words, AI-generated content often can be flagged as non-human-made by its unique presentation.
In order to ease this problem, we introduce a simple approach to select the AI-generated contents that might give a result that has lower probability of being detected as AI by current free AI detector tools.
The main idea of the method is to combine a knowledge base, which is being integrated to a small machine learning model for quick and precise result retrieval, with the various output of the Generative AI to filter out the best candidate.
